# Double-Slit Simulation

This folder contains the **double_slit_sim** program used in the Boundary-Condition Quantum Mechanics (BCQM) project.

## Purpose
The simulation models interference in a double-slit experiment under the BCQM framework.  
It allows comparison between:
- Standard quantum mechanical interference patterns.
- BCQM predictions with collapse horizon (W) and re-coherence horizon (V).

## Contents
- `double_slit_sim.py`: Main Python program for running the simulation.
- `outputs/`: Example plots and data generated by the program.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in this folder.  
2. Ensure Python and dependencies are installed.  
3. Run the simulation with:
   ```bash
   python double_slit_sim.py
   ```
4. Adjust parameters for number of particles, slit separation, and horizons (W, V) by editing the script.

## Outputs
The program generates:
- Interference plots (with and without coherence effects).
- Histograms of landing distributions.
- Comparisons between coherent and incoherent sums.

All output files are saved in the `outputs/` folder.

## Notes
- The program is a **research prototype**: simple and lightweight for conceptual exploration, not optimized for performance.
- Parameters can be tuned to reproduce toy results from the BCQM paper.
